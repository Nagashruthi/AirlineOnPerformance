#After running these commands, we found out that arrival delay is highly correlated with departure delay and late aircraft delay
#We built a multiple linear regression model to predict how much would be the arriaval delay, given the depature delay and the late aircraft delay
lmmodel<-lm(inp$ArrDelay~inp$DepDelay+inp$LateAircraftDelay,data=inp)
summary(lmmodel)
#Observing the co-efficients of the summary of lmmodel, we get a linear equation which calculates the arrival delay
